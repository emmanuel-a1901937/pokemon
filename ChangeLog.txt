Change: Changed class hierarchy structure for StatusMove and DefenceMove classes.
Description: StatusMove and DefenceMove no longer have child classes. Since StatusMove and DefenceMove 
behaviors do not depend on the Pokemon object’s Type attribute, the type-based child classes of FireStatusMove, 
WaterStatusMove etc. were unnecessary.

Change: Moved “useMove” function from Move child classes to Pokemon child classes.

between Pokemon.h and Move.h. It now takes Move* and Pokemon* parameters, calling appropriate functions based 
on the move type.
